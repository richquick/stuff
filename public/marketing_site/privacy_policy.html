                        We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.

                    <p>
                        Our website uses certain cookies. A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we put on your computer if you agree. These cookies allow us to distinguish you from other users of our website, which helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site.&nbsp; The cookies we use are "analytical" cookies (third party cookie services being Google Analytics, KISSMetrics and Intercom). They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around the site when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily. You can change your website browser settings to reject cookies although this may impair the functionality of our website.</p>
                    <h2>Where we store your personal data</h2>
                    <p>
                        All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. [Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology and using trusted third parties.] Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>

                        Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
                    <h2>Uses made of the information</h2>
                    <p>
                        We use information held about you in the following ways:</p>
